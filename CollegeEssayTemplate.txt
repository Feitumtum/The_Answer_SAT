Thank You for Sending {Sname} to The Answer College Essay Writing Workshop!

Dear {title} {Lname},

Hope you are doing well. We are writing to update you on the College Essay Writing Workshop that {Sname} {recently attended}.  

{Sname} was a pleasure to have in class. {Ugender1} were interested, involved, and engaged. {Ugender1} participated in all of the activities, collaborated well with others, and wrote a lot! Understanding the context of the college essays and then brainstorming, drafting, writing, and editing is not what most teenagers do for fun, but {Sname} did a great job of making it worthwhile. 

In the workshop, the students…

{bulletPoint} Brainstormed individually and collaboratively: They participated in activities to help them think through their life experiences and find topics that are both true to themselves and interesting and relevant to the essay readers. 
{bulletPoint} Examined and worked through the seven Common App essay choices to apply their ideas to these prompts and debunked myths about the college essay writing process 
{bulletPoint} Learned how getting started writing is half the battle, so we discussed strategies to find the best writing environment for each student, and then practiced outlining, freewriting, and pumped out a first draft
{bulletPoint} Delved into editing – both self-editing and peer editing 
{bulletPoint} Gained additional takeaways: practiced breathing exercises to stay calm during the writing process, learned about the drawbacks of AI writing, and discussed supplemental essay requirements for various colleges
{bulletPoint} Came out of the workshop with a first draft of the main college essay and the skills to edit, refine, and perfect it from there
{bulletPoint} As with all writing, students should still review, edit, and even share with you, a sibling, a cousin, or their English teacher to get another perspective and additional edits –  but they've done all the hard work and the heavy lifting.  Furthermore, all of this effort will not only help for the college essays but also all of the writing they will do in college and beyond.
