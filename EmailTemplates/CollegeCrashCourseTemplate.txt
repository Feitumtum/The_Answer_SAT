Dear {parentName},

We hope you are doing well. As the instructors for the The Answer Class’s College Admissions Crash Course that {studentName} {recently attended}, we would like to give you an update on the progress that {he_she_they} made.

{studentName} was an attentive student and a wonderful addition to the classroom. {He_She_They} made an effort to absorb the material and contributed thoughtful reflections to our class discussions. We know that the college application process can be stressful and overwhelming, but {studentName} embraced the course and worked diligently to plan out {his_her_their} college application strategy. 

As the college application process is multifaceted, we covered a lot of ground in the workshop. {studentName} learned how to find colleges and majors that suit {his_her_their} interests. {He_She_They} learned about what colleges are looking for and how to build a compelling application that demonstrates {his_her_their} best skills and talents to colleges. Your student created a plan for taking standardized tests, participated in a mock college interview, learned how to write a concise resume and supplemental essays, and finally, drafted a timeline of when to apply to {his_her_their} different schools. Thank you for supporting {his_her_their} college application process by having {him_her_them} attend class.

Applying to college means juggling many different responsibilities. Beyond securing their desired test scores and grades, students must fill out pages of Common App forms, request teacher recommendations, research potential schools, and keep track of those schools’ requirements and deadlines. For many students, it is one of the first major exercises in project management, and all these tasks can seem daunting. However, armed with their College Admissions Crash Course Student Guide, students now have the tools they need to tackle each step as it comes. In the coming months, your student can refer back to the information in our curriculum, as well as the application plans that {he_she_they} developed for {himself_herself_themself}. 

Ultimately, the college selection and application process is all about finding the right fit for each individual student, and all students will get accepted into a college that is right for them. There is no one perfect school — successful people have graduated from all types of post-secondary institutions. We have full confidence that {studentName} has a plethora of options where {he_she_they} will thrive.
